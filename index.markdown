## How We Change Children's Lives

Teenagers living near Karatu District, Mang'ola County, Tanzania face a difficult environment causing many of them to drop out of school before completing their primary education. This in turn leads to:

- Child pregnancies and early marriages
- Abandonment by fathers
- Young men drifting into drugs and theft
- Sexual violence against teenagers
- Economic hardship preventing school attendance

Recognizing the importance of a holistic approach, our initiative equips teenagers with:

✓ **English Language Skills**  
✓ **Basic Computer Skills**  
✓ **Reading and Writing**  
✓ **Financial Literacy**  
✓ **Entrepreneurship**

Our ultimate goal is to help these children improve their lives by preparing them to continue their education in secondary or technical school, helping them find local employment, or pursuing careers in the military.
