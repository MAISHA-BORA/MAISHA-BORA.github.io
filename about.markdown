# Maisha Bora Youth Foundation

## Who We Are

Maisha Bora Youth Foundation is a comprehensive youth development organization serving teenagers aged 13-20 years in Karatu District, Mang'ola County, Tanzania. Founded on the belief that every young person deserves the opportunity to thrive, we work tirelessly to break the cycle of poverty and disadvantage through holistic programming.

## The Challenge

In today's rapidly changing world, teenagers in our community face numerous challenges that impact their overall well-being:

### Environmental Challenges
- **Educational Barriers**: Many teenagers drop out of school before completing primary education due to economic hardship and lack of school fees
- **Child Pregnancies & Early Marriage**: Young girls often become pregnant and marry early, leading to abandonment by fathers and endangering both mother and child
- **Youth Delinquency**: Young men drift into drug use (particularly marijuana) and theft due to lack of opportunities
- **Sexual Violence**: Teenagers face sexual violence within the community
- **Economic Hardship**: Families struggle to provide basic necessities and educational opportunities

## Our Response

Recognizing the importance of a holistic approach to development, our initiative aims to equip teenagers with the necessary tools, resources, and support systems that foster their spiritual, social, and economic growth.

### Target Audience

We primarily serve teenagers aged **13-20 years** from diverse backgrounds, with a special focus on underserved communities. Our goal is to reach:
- **25 teenagers per month**
- **300 teenagers per year** (with plans for expansion)

## Vision Statement

**"A community where teenagers are holistically empowered to lead purposeful and fulfilling lives."**

## Mission Statement

**"To provide comprehensive programs and resources that nurture teenagers' spiritual, social, and economic development, enabling them to pursue meaningful and fulfilling lives."**
